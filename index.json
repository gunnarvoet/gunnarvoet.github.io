Quickly, one accumulates a bunch of journal articles in pdf format and the need for some kind of literature database arises. After many years of using BibDesk I recently switched to Zotero and have been quite happy so far with my new workflow. BibDesk is still an excellent tool and I only stumbled upon Zotero when I was looking for a bibliography management system that easily syncs between macos and Linux operating systems.\nIn the following, I describe how I set up Zotero to quite efficiently fulfill my needs for filing, referencing, and reading journal articles and books. The setup also syncs my literature database between individual computers (and operating systems!). This writeup is probably not overly interesting unless you write papers in LaTeX with the help of the BibTeX bibliography tool. There are other guides out there that talk about, for example, how to integrate Zotero with your favorite Word processor.\nZotero is open source software and can be installed via direct download or using the software manager of your choice and/or operating system. Make sure to also install the browser connector in your web browser, also available from the download page. It provides a button in your web browser that allows for quickly (one click is all that\u0026rsquo;s usually needed!) adding a journal article, including the pdf file, to your Zotero database.\nThe ZotFile and Better BibTex plugins are key to my workflow. ZotFile helps with automatically renaming and filing pdf files. It also allows for keeping the pdf file collection outside the Zotero database, thereby allowing for syncing using the file syncing software of your choice and avoiding paying for the Zotero sync service that charges for databases larger than 300MB. If you don\u0026rsquo;t mind paying a bit for their service you can of course simply use Zotero\u0026rsquo;s online storage and thereby support the nonprofit Corporation for Digital Scholarship that develops and runs Zotero. I prefer to have my pdfs outside the Zotero database just in case I ever want to change to a different system. I use the open source tool Syncthing to sync my paper collection with my office server but services like Dropbox or Google Drive should work equally well. Here is how I set ZotFile to save new pdf files to a specific directory (and subsequently have them sorted into one folder per author name). The pdf files can be renamed to your liking using various patterns. Here is how I rename to first author / year / title which I find a nice format for when I share the pdf file with colleagues: If you use ZotFile to store pdfs outside the Zotero database make sure to disable Zotero file syncing: The Better BibTex plugin allows for automatic generation of BibTex citation keys and automatic export of the whole database (or subsets thereof) to .bib files. Here are my settings for generating citation keys that follow the pattern author1yy, author1author2yy, and author1etalyy depending on the number of authors on the paper. To export the database to bibtex format, right click it in the left side bar (either your whole Library or only a Collection), choose Export Library, and in the following dialogue select Better BibTex and check the Keep updated and Background export options. Now, whenever new entries are added to your Zotero database, they will also be added to the corresponding .bib database. The Automatic export tab of the Better BibTex settings lets you adjust automatic exports set up this way.\nIf you are migrating to Zotero from BibDesk, the bibdesk2zotero tool may be very helpful in preserving your already existing pdf database along with your existing bibtex database. Run the following command in your terminal and the newly generated .bib file should be ready for importing to Zotero with working pdf file links:\nbibdesk2zotero citations.bib /path/to/pdf/files/ \u0026gt; new-citations.bib One feature of Zotero that I really like is the ability of adding new entries (including downloading the corresponding pdf of a paper) by providing just a doi. Simply copy the doi into the magic wand field (button on the top toolbar) and - et voilà! - the publication has been added to your database and you can start reading the paper right away.\n","date":1687465177,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687465177,"objectID":"323406a535b00b65636d0362c56233f7","permalink":"https://gunnarvoet.github.io/post/zotero/","publishdate":"2023-06-22T13:19:37-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/zotero/","section":"post","summary":"How I manage publications using Zotero and its Better BibTex and ZotFile plugins","tags":[],"title":"Publication Management with Zotero","type":"post"},{"authors":["Gunnar Voet","Matthew Alford","Jesse Cusack","Larry Pratt","James Girton","Glenn Carter","Jody Klymak","Shuwen Tan","Andreas Thurnherr"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685577600,"objectID":"6152d22cef10d020589a513f70504942","permalink":"https://gunnarvoet.github.io/publication/journal-article/samoan-passage-northern-sill/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/samoan-passage-northern-sill/","section":"publication","summary":"The energy and momentum balance of an abyssal overflow across a major sill in the Samoan Passage is estimated from two highly resolved towed sections, set 16 months apart, and results from a two-dimensional numerical simulation. Driven by the density anomaly across the sill, the flow is relatively steady. The system gains energy from divergence of horizontal pressure work $\\mathcal{O}$(5)\u0026nbsp;kW\u0026nbsp;m{{\u003c sup \"-1\" \u003e}} and flux of available potential energy $\\mathcal{O}$(2)\u0026nbsp;kW\u0026nbsp;m{{\u003c sup \"-1\" \u003e}}. Approximately half of these gains are transferred into kinetic energy while the other half is lost to turbulent dissipation, bottom drag, and divergence in vertical pressure work. Small-scale internal waves emanating downstream of the sill within the overflow layer radiate $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\u0026nbsp;kW\u0026nbsp;m{{\u003c sup \"-1\" \u003e}} upwards but dissipate most of their energy within the dense overflow layer and at its upper interface. The strongly sheared and highly stratified upper interface acts as a critical layer inhibiting any appreciable upward radiation of energy via topographically generated lee waves. Form drag of $\\mathcal{O}$(2)\u0026nbsp;N\u0026nbsp;m{{\u003c sup \"-2\" \u003e}}, estimated from the pressure drop across the sill, is consistent with energy lost to dissipation and internal wave fluxes. The topographic drag removes momentum from the mean flow, slowing it down and feeding a counter current aloft. The processes discussed in this study combine to convert about one third of the energy released from the cross-sill density difference into turbulent mixing within the overflow and at its upper interface. The observed and modeled vertical momentum flux divergence sustains gradients in shear and stratification, thereby maintaining an efficient route for abyssal water mass transformation downstream of this Samoan Passage sill.

Hugging the eastern continental shelf of the North American continent, it flows northwards until it detaches from the coast at Cape Hatteras. The current soon encounters a number of submarine mountains as it heads into the open North Atlantic Ocean - the New England Seamount Chain.\nTheoretical work and studies based on numerical simulations have shown the importance of the seamounts for the path the Gulf Stream takes. They also predict strong turbulent mixing in the vicinity of the seamounts as the interaction with the Gulf Stream generates internal waves and eddies in the lee. Gulf Stream - seamount interaction may thus be important for water mass transformation in the deep ocean which in turn is an important driver of the so-called Global Overturning Circulation, an important element of our climate system.\nObservations of the phenomena associated with this type of flow-topography interaction are rare not only for these specific seamounts but even on a global scale.

Commonly known as the two siblings El Niño and La Niña, ENSO is a complex interplay of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics that influences communities surrounding the Pacific Ocean and beyond. While there has been tremendous progress in the understanding of the ENSO phenomenon over the past few decades, which has led to the ability to forecast ENSO conditions over the time span of several months, the detailed processes driving and modifying ENSO are not very well understood yet.\nThe cold tongue of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean plays a critical role in driving and modifying ENSO conditions. It can become unstable and form tropical instability waves (TIWs) that extend several hundred kilometers away from the equator (see the figure at the top for an example of the cold tongue and how it forms waves). Recent studies have indicated that turbulent mixing in the ocean, caused by TIWs directly at the equator, plays an important role for the heat budget of the cold tongue with important implications for ENSO. TIWs are much more prevalent during La Niña conditions when the cold tongue is more pronounced than during El Niño or neutral ENSO years.\nIn this project funded by the National Science Foundation we aim at studying turbulent mixing processes away from the equator (within about 5°) that may be associated with TIW fronts through their potential for creating or modifying internal waves. The generation of internal waves, or modification of incoming internal waves generated elsewhere, may lead to increased velocity shear which in turn can provide a route to wave breaking and turbulent mixing. Preliminary results from Argo float data show a correlation between elevated turbulent mixing well below the thermocline and stronger TIW activity during La Niña years. Using a combination of yearlong moored observations and two dedicated cruises in 2024 and 2025 where we will bring the MOD fastCTD, Epsifish, and drifting Wirewalkers, we will collect data at TIW fronts that will help us better understand internal wave dynamics associated with the fronts and how they may lead to ocean turbulence and the turbulent transport of heat within the ocean.\nThe project is a collaboration between Caitlin Whalen at APL/UW, Jim Moum at OSU, and Amy Waterhouse \u0026amp; Gunnar Voet at Scripps.\n","date":1662940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662940800,"objectID":"b6257cfe1c1e3d38e84deceee599550c","permalink":"https://gunnarvoet.github.io/project/motive/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/motive/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluating mixing mechanisms and associated turbulent heat fluxes below tropical instability waves near the equator.","tags":["motive"],"title":"Mixing Below Tropical Instability Waves","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Turbulence and abyssal upwelling in deep bottom boundary layers.

However, they tend to get a little messy as a project grows in size and I have gotten into the habit of moving most of my code into external packages which I then import into a notebook. This way, I can still keep figures and notes in the notebook while keeping the analysis code modular and being able to edit it in an external editor. Using IPython\u0026rsquo;s %autoreload magic, the external code can automatically be udpated inside the notebook every time a cell is re-evaluated. Awesome! The only slightly annoying part of this workflow is having to jump back and forth between editor and notebook every time the code has been changed, just to re-evaluate a cell.\nMeet watchmagic. It adds the %%watch magic command to IPython. If added to the top of a cell, %%watch will observe a given directory and re-evaluate the cell on file changes. This way, I only have to save my progress in the editor and can watch the notebook update by itself whenever I change a file. Under the hood, watchmagic leverages the watchdog package.\nInstallation of watchmagic is as simple as\npip install watchmagic A very basic example of displaying a plot in the notebook with analysis code development in the external file science_plots.py may look like this:\n# import external package with analysis code import science_plots # load autoreload magic %load_ext autoreload # set autoreload to act on all imports %autoreload 2 # load watch magic %load_ext watchmagic %%watch --patterns *.py # call external code science_plots.overview_plot() After editing science_plots.py and saving it, the plot will be updated:\nwatch: ./science_plots.py has been modified By default, %%watch will look for changes in the current directory. A different directory can be supplied via the --path command line option. In the example above the --patterns command line option is used to only look for changes in *.py files. The following command line options are available:\n-p PATH, --path PATH provides the PATH to watch for file changes. If not provided, the current directory will be watched. -r, --recursive include subdirectories recursively when watching for file changes.

The waves were generated by a superposition of tidal and low-frequency flows and thus had two distinct energy sources with combined amplitudes of up to 0.2 m/s. Local breaking of the waves led to enhanced rates of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy reaching above 10-6 W/kg in the lee of the ridge near topography. Turbulence observations showed a stark contrast between conditions at spring and neap tide. During spring tide, when the tidal flow dominated, turbulence was approximately equally distributed around both sides of the ridge. During neap tide, when the mean flow dominated over tidal oscillations, turbulence was mostly observed on the downstream side of the ridge relative to the mean flow.

The goal of the mooring deployments was twofold: First, the BLT team wanted to practice deploying and recovering a mooring system we are borrowing from our colleague Hans van Haren from NIOZ in the Netherlands. The NIOZ mooring sports a large number of in-house-built high-precision temperature sensors with their clocks synched via an inductive pulse. Their measurements provide information on ocean stratification at high frequencies and high vertical resolution and can be used to study turbulence. Second, we wanted to test a new design for a MAVS mooring. MAVS are acoustic travel time current meters that, paired with high precision thermistors, can be used to directly measure buoyancy fluxes. The test deployment of the MAVS will tell us whether the mooring is designed stable enough to allow for the high precision measurements needed to directly observe buoyancy fluxes. Eventually, both of these mooring types will be deployed during the main experimental phase of BLT in the Rockall Trough in summer 2020.\nToday, we successfully recovered both moorings and brought all instruments safely back on board. The weather conditions offshore were perfect for smooth mooring recoveries from the R/V Sproul, one of the smaller ships of the research fleet based in San Diego. Data analysis in the upcoming days will tell us how the moorings performed and whether adjustments are needed before the moorings will be deployed in the Rockall Trough. An exciting byproduct of the test deployment will be information on near bottom flow conditions, stratification, turbulence and buoyancy fluxes in the San Diego Trough, a region so close to Scripps Institution of Oceanography and yet not very well explored.\nMooring locations in the San Diego Trough.

Thorpe scale based estimates of dissipation from moored profilers deployed on top of two sills for 17 months reveal that turbulence is continuously generated in the Passage. Overturns were observed in a density band where the Richardson number was often smaller than 1/4, consistent with shear instability occurring at the upper interface of the fast flowing bottom water layer. The magnitude of dissipation was found to be stable on long time scales from weeks to months. A second array of 12 moored profilers deployed for a shorter duration but profiling at higher frequency was able to resolve variability in dissipation on time scales of days to hours. At some mooring locations near-inertial and tidal modulation of the dissipation rate was observed. However, the modulation was not spatially coherent across the Passage. The magnitude and vertical structure of dissipation from observations at one of the major sills is compared with an idealised 2D numerical simulation that includes a barotropic tidal forcing. Depth integrated dissipation rates agree between model and observations to within a factor of 3. The tide has a negligible effect on the mean dissipation.

A recent field campaign has shown that this flow is hydraulically controlled and that it experiences hydraulic jumps accompanied by strong mixing and dissipation concentrated near several deep sills. By our estimates, the diapycnal density flux associated with this mixing is considerably larger than the diapycnal flux across a typical isopycnal surface extending over the abyssal North Pacific. According to historical hydrographic observations, a second source of abyssal water for the North Pacific is 2.3–2.8 Sv of the dense flow that is diverted around the Manihiki Plateau to the east, bypassing the Samoan Passage. This bypass flow is not confined to a channel and is therefore less likely to experience the strong mixing that is associated with hydraulic transitions. The partitioning of flux between the two branches of the deep flow could therefore be relevant to the distribution of Pacific abyssal mixing. To gain insight into the factors that control the partitioning between these two branches, we develop an abyssal and equator-proximal extension of the “island rule.” Novel features include provisions for the presence of hydraulic jumps as well as identification of an appropriate integration circuit for an abyssal layer to the east of the island. Evaluation of the corresponding circulation integral leads to a prediction of 0.4–2.4 Sv of bypass flow. The circulation integral clearly identifies dissipation and frictional drag effects within the Samoan Passage as crucial elements in partitioning the flow.","tags":["samoan-passage"],"title":"Pacific Abyssal Transport and Mixing: Through the Samoan Passage versus around the Manihiki Plateau","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The goal of this cruise was to deploy three moorings in the Iceland Basin, the part of the North Atlantic south of Iceland.

Their generation, evolution and decay still remain poorly understood. Recent advances in theory and numerical modeling have pointed to interactions of near-inertial waves with mesoscale and submescoscale features.\nSchematic showing processes associated with near-inertial generation, dissipation, and propagation. As storms move along the storm track (thick white arrow), a local response occurs with frequencies near the local Coriolis frequency. Both high- and low-mode internal gravity waves are excited. High modes propagate along curving characteristics downward and equatorward. The higher modes have strong shear that results in mixing, ε(z).

In May 2019 we deployed an array of three moorings, outfitted with ADCPs, McLane Moored Profilers, thermistors \u0026amp; microcats and turbulence-measuring chipods, in the center of the Iceland Basin. The moorings will provide time series of shear and stratification during times of the field experiment, when a lot of autonomous instruments will be deployed around the moorings, and during the spring and fall storm seasons, when the forcing of near-inertial waves is expected to be strongest.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c286378f4d5ebd00ae5a9414d3de2648","permalink":"https://gunnarvoet.github.io/project/niskine/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/niskine/","section":"project","summary":"ONR-funded project to study the generation, propagation and decay of near-inertial waves in the North Atlantic","tags":["niskine"],"title":"Near-Inertial Shear and Kinetic Energy in the North Atlantic Experiment - NISKINe","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528156800,"objectID":"df40f702648b91bd72fac31a1127e286","permalink":"https://gunnarvoet.github.io/talk/gordon-conference-mixing-2018/","publishdate":"2018-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/gordon-conference-mixing-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":" Lee wave observations over a tall ridge ","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The oceanographic part of the PISTON experiment aims at better understanding three-dimensional oceanic processes that may influence the propagation of multi- scale convective systems in the atmosphere.

Here we report recent measurements of the flow of dense waters of Antarctic and North Atlantic origin through the Samoan Passage. A fifteen month long moored time series of velocity and temperature of the abyssal flow was recorded between 2012 and 2013. This allows for an update of the only prior volume transport time series from the Samoan Passage from WOCE moored measurements between 1992 to 1994. While highly variable on multiple time scales, the overall pattern of the abyssal flow through the Samoan Passage was remarkably steady. The time-mean northward volume transport of about 5.4 Sv in 2012/2013 was reduced compared to 6.0 Sv measured between 1992 and 1994. This volume transport reduction is significant within 68% confidence limits ($\\pm$0.4 Sv) but not at 95% confidence limits ($\\pm$0.6 Sv). In agreement with recent studies of the abyssal Pacific, the bottom flow through the Samoan Passage warmed significantly on average by $1\\times10^{-3}$°C per year over the past two decades as observed both in moored and shipboard hydrographic observations. While the warming reflects the recently observed increasing role of the deep oceans for heat uptake, decreasing flow through Samoan Passage may indicate a future weakening of this trend for the abyssal North Pacific.","tags":["samoan-passage"],"title":"Warming and Weakening of the flow through Samoan Passage","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"We spent three weeks on R/V Roger Revelle to study flow-topography interactions in the vicinity of Palau in the tropical North Pacific.\nThis was my first time as a co-PI on a research cruise.

Specifically, the flow accelerates substantially at the primary sill within the passage, reaching speeds as great as 0.55$\\,$m/s.  A strong hydraulic response is seen, with layers first rising to clear the sill, then plunging hundreds of meters downwards.  Turbulence results from high shear at the interface above the densest fluid as it descends, and from hydraulic jumps that form downstream of the sill. In addition to the primary sill, other locations along the multiple interconnected channels through the Samoan Passage also have an effect on the mixing of the dense water. In fact, quite different hydraulic responses and turbulence levels are observed at seafloor features separated laterally by a few kilometers, indicating the need for accurate knowledge of small-scale bathymetry in parameterizing mixing in abyssal flows.","tags":["samoan-passage"],"title":"Turbulent mixing and hydraulic control of abyssal water in the Samoan Passage","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The Samoan Passage is the major gateway for deep water renewal in the North Pacific where virtually no bottom waters are formed locally. About 6 Sv (1 Sv $\\equiv 1 \\times 10^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$), more than half of the abyssal northward limb of the Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), flows through the Samoan Passage while smaller amounts flow across Robbie Ridge to the west and around the Manihiki Plateau to the east. As the bottom current is forced through the narrow channels and across the sills of the Samoan Passage it is strongly modified by turbulent mixing.\nIn the NSF-funded Samoan Passage Abyssal Mixing Experiment we gathered moored and shipboard measurements to re-assess the long term volume transport through the Samoan Passage and to study flow pathways and turbulent mixing processes in the Samoan Passage. Moored long-term observations of the abyssal flow through the Samoan Passage, when compared to historical measurements, showed a slightly weakened volume transport by about 0.6 Sv or 10% and a significant warming of $1\\times10^{-3}$ K/yr over the past two decades. Shipboard CTD/LADCP sections from a cruise in 2012 revealed the flow pathways through the Samoan Passage with the unanticipated result of about half the volume transport going through shallower channels to the west while the other, denser, half goes through the main eastern channel. Topographic sills along both pathways lead to hydraulic response and strong associated acceleration and mixing of the flow. Detailed measurements at the primary sill of the eastern channel showed flow acceleration to more than 0.5 m/s. The first direct turbulence measurements with an autonomous Vertical Microstructure Profiler in the Samoan Passage revealed 1000 to 10,000 times stronger turbulence than oceanographic background levels. Heat-budget derived estimates of turbulent mixing levels were 2 to 6 times higher than area-averaged mixing levels in the Samoan Passage, pointing to the importance of mixing concentrated at so-called hot-spots. These mixing hot-spots are located downstream of the sills, where the flow, likely hydraulically controlled, accelerates, and hydraulic jumps with the highest mixing levels in the region were observed.\nSee the Data section for a link to the data archive.\n","date":133056e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":133056e4,"objectID":"9397d494d053b3e5e118c0e64637b596","permalink":"https://gunnarvoet.github.io/project/samoan-passage/","publishdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/samoan-passage/","section":"project","summary":"NSF-funded project to study volume transport and mixing processes in the abyssal flow through the Samoan Passage","tags":["samoan-passage"],"title":"Samoan Passage Abyssal Mixing Experiment","type":"project"},{"authors":["Gunnar Voet","Detlef Quadfasel","Kjell-Arne Mork","Henrik Søiland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1277942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1277942400,"objectID":"2e3a7533430a17cdbd72b33f58092486","permalink":"https://gunnarvoet.github.io/publication/journal-article/nordic-seas-circulation/","publishdate":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/nordic-seas-circulation/","section":"publication","summary":"The trajectories of 61 profiling Argo floats deployed at mid-depth in the Nordic Seas—the Greenland, Lofoten and Norwegian Basins and the Iceland Plateau—between 2001 and 2009 are analysed to determine the pattern, strength and variability of the regional circulation.
